PatentRadar ("the App") helps users discover and analyze government patents available for licensing. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
- **Claude API Key**: If you choose to enable AI features, you provide your own Anthropic API key
- **Saved Patents**: Patents you bookmark are stored locally on your device
- **Problem History**: Your problem-solving queries are stored locally for convenience

### What We Don't Collect
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your location

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally on your device**:
- **API Key**: Stored securely in iOS Keychain (Apple's encrypted storage)
- **Saved Patents**: Stored in local app storage (UserDefaults)
- **Search History**: Stored in local app storage (UserDefaults)

**We do not operate any servers or databases.** Your data never leaves your device except when:
1. Fetching patent data from NASA's public Technology Transfer Portal
2. Sending queries to Anthropic's Claude API (only if you enable AI features with your own API key)

## Third-Party Services

### NASA Technology Transfer Portal

- You use your own API key, not ours
- Anthropic's privacy policy applies: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.

## Contact
